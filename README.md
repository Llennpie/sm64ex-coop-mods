# sm64ex-coop-mods
A small collection of [sm64ex-coop](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop) mods I've made.

---

### Project OwOify

*Now ported to sm64ex-coop!*

- This mod adds both **Mawio** (now colorable via palettes) and all existing modified/cursed textures into the game.
  - Mawio can be toggled by selecting Mario and using the `/mawio` command.
- Note the original texture pack was never really finished, so not all levels have been edited.

`Original mod created by K1LLRxK1TT3H, chloerawr, Napstio, sm64rise (me), and KawaiiTemDev. Ported by me with permission`

### Freeze Tag

*Note: This is my first ever ex-coop mod, so it's probably very broken! Proceed with caution...*

```
A simple Freeze Tag gamemode, best playable with 4 or more players.

RULES:

- Every round, "It" is chosen at random. They are shown with METAL Mario colors. "It" must tag Runners before time runs out.
- When "It" tags a Runner, they are frozen and cannot move. Only other Runners can unfreeze Runners.
- If all Runners are frozen, "It" wins. If time runs out, the Runners win! SURVIVE until time runs out!!!

### Muberk...?

It's all Muberk...? Always has been.
(This is a joke mod, it sets everyone's model to the Super Mario 64 machinimist known as Muberk)
